h3. requirements / installation

It thas been tested on OS X with PD Extended 0.41.4, but should probably work with other OS and versions. You need Java 1.4 and the pdj plugin from "www.le-son666.com/software/pdj/":http://www.le-son666.com/software/pdj/ . It has been tested with pdj 0.8.7.

If you don't have the binary (@PDOSCClient.jar@), compile the sources with

* @ant@

And you will find a bundled jar in the build folder. Install pdj, for instance on OS X copy the pdj folder into @/Applications/Pd-extended.app/Contents/Plugins@. Then copy @PDOSCClient.jar@ into pdj's @classes@ folder. Go into that folder and unpack the jar

* @jar xf PDOSCClient.jar@

Re-open PD and try out the examples patch.
